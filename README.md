Price Prediction Model using RandomForestRegressor

Overview
Welcome to the House Price Prediction project! This repository contains the code and resources for predicting house prices using Machine Learning techniques, specifically Decision Trees and Random Forest.

Features
This project includes the following key features:

Data loading and preprocessing.
Implementation of Decision Tree and Random Forest models.
Model evaluation and interpretation.
Insights derived from feature importance analysis.

Data Preprocessing
Before training the models, the data is preprocessed:

Handling missing values through imputation.
Scaling features for better model performance.
Encoding categorical variables using one-hot encoding.

Model Building
The Decision Trees and Random Forest models are built with the following steps:

Decision Trees: Using the scikit-learn library to create a decision tree regressor and fine-tune hyperparameters.
Random Forest: Implementation of a Random Forest regressor with ensemble learning to improve prediction accuracy.

Evaluation
Model performance is evaluated using metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE) on the test dataset.

Results and Insights
The project yields the following insights:

Feature importance analysis reveals that square footage and location significantly influence house prices.
The Random Forest model outperforms the Decision Tree model in terms of prediction accuracy.
The models provide a valuable tool for predicting house prices and gaining insights into real estate market dynamics.

Future Enhancements
Possible future enhancements to this project include:

Incorporating more advanced regression algorithms for comparison.
Exploring additional features such as neighborhood characteristics and market trends.
Creating a user-friendly web interface for interactive house price predictions.
